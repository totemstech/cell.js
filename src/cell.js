/**
 * Cell object
 * 
 * A `cell` is an object in charge of building and refreshing a precise 
 * UI part. Cells are hierarchical: it means that building and refreshing
 * is done recursively
 * 
 * This pattern was introduced by Google here:
 * http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/cell/client/Cell.html
 * 
 * Each cell has a specific path and refers to a JSON data object whose
 * structure is "close" (if not similar) to the cell hierarchy. A specific
 * cell can be recusively found from the top cell thanks to its path. Finally
 * cells bubble up the 'update' event whenever it is fired (generally due to
 * a UI interaction) 
 * 
 * Cells help the creation modular and reusable code even in complex inter dependent
 * environments. Each cell is in charge of a specific UI part. UI handlers should
 * be implemented within the cell. Cells are globally adressable thanks to their path.
 * Building and refreshing can be contextual to the json data or the path of the cell
 * allowing the reuse of specific cells in different contexts.
 *
 * The JSON passed to the top cell should have an adequate hierarchy. Each cell reference
 * the JSON part it is in charge of. When the JSON is updated in a children cell, every cell
 * have access to the updated JSON thanks to JS object model.
 *
 * @extends CELL.emitter
 *
 * @emits 'update'
 *
 * @param spec {path, container}
