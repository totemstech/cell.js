 * Container object
 * 
 * The `container` is the TOP level object which contains a set of children 
 * cells. The container is passed to all the cell within the hierarchy and
 * is therefore referenceable from any cell within one of its hierarchies.
 * The container is in charge of loading a builded hierachy within the DOM
 * in the `load` function. All events emitted by cells are forwarded up to
 * the top-level cells and can be listened by the container. Finally the
 * container is supposed to act as a controller between the views (cell
 * hierarchies) and its data representation. This data representation is
 * built to be compatbile with cell refresh and splitted across cells. When 
 * the data model it handles is updated, refresh should be called on the
 * children cells.
